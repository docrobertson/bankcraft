# Jupyter Notebook Restriction Rule

## Purpose
This rule prohibits the creation and editing of Jupyter Notebook files due to current integration issues between the AI agent and Cursor.

## Restrictions
- DO NOT create new Jupyter Notebook files (*.ipynb)
- DO NOT edit existing Jupyter Notebook files
- DO NOT suggest modifications to Jupyter Notebook files

## Allowed Actions
- Reading existing Jupyter Notebook files is permitted
- Searching within Jupyter Notebook files is permitted
- Discussing the content of Jupyter Notebook files is permitted

## Reason
The integration between the AI agent and Cursor currently has issues with Jupyter Notebook files, causing direct attempts to create or edit notebook files to fail.

## Alternative Approaches
If notebook-like functionality is needed, consider suggesting:
- Python scripts (*.py) with markdown comments
- Markdown files (*.md) with code blocks
- Other text-based formats that can be properly edited in Cursor
